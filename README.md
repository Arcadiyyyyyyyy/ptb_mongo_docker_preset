### This is preset to skip all the boring parts of creating a telegram bot.

To get started, simply fork the repository 

But, you will have to change the naming manually. 

### Initial setup
To do so, rename 2 directories called "ptb_mongo_docker_preset" to the name of your repo.

__*Important â€” they have to be named the same*__

Then change ["name", "packages include", "addopts", "mypy_path"] in pyproject.toml to the name of your repo.

And then change `ptb_mongo_docker_preset` in "commands" lines in tox.ini to the name of your repo.

### Poetry setup

Run `pip install poetry`

Run `poetry install`

Select poetry venv in your IDE

### .env setup
Create a file with the name .env in the project home directory, and add it there:

```
TG_BOT_TOKEN=your_tg_bot_token
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_uri
```

### Startup

To start the script, run `poetry run python __main__.py` inside of the module directory (~/your_repo_name/your_repo_name>), 
or run from IDE with `python __main__.py` 

### Commits

Before committing your code, run `pip install -r requirements_dev` inside of your venv. 

Run `tox` in your home project folder to run all tests before commit, or run them separately with:

`mypy your_repo_name` <br>
`pytest` <br>
`flake8`
